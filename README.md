# Japanese Flashcards
  ## Description
    Japanese Flashcards is a React SPA (Single Page Application) that allows users to quiz themselves from among different categories of Japanese words and phrases, such as nouns, verbs, and numbers.
    A library page also displays the entire word bank of words that can be quizzed.  Users can select one or multiple categories and switch between the Japanese and English translations for each word or phrase,
    to really help solidify memorization.
